# Enhanced Audit Log System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

I have implemented a comprehensive audit logging system that addresses all your concerns about missing login/registration logs and 500 error tracking. The system now automatically logs all authentication events, HTTP errors, and exceptions.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Missing Login/Registration Logs**
- **Problem**: Authentication events were not being saved to the audit log table
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `AuthService` with comprehensive logging for all authentication events

### 2. **No 500 Error Logging**
- **Problem**: HTTP errors and exceptions were not being captured in audit logs
- **Solution**: Created `AuditLoggingMiddleware` and enhanced `GlobalExceptionMiddleware` to capture all HTTP errors

### 3. **Authentication Required for Audit Creation**
- **Problem**: AuditLogService required authentication, preventing error logging from failed requests
- **Solution**: Added anonymous `/api/auditlog/internal` endpoint for inter-service communication

## New Components

### 1. **AuditLoggingMiddleware** (`Shared/Store.Shared/Middleware/AuditLoggingMiddleware.cs`)
- Automatically logs all HTTP requests and responses
- Captures request/response details, timing, and status codes
- Differentiates between normal responses, client errors (4xx), and server errors (5xx)
- Skips logging for health checks, swagger, and static files

### 2. **Enhanced GlobalExceptionMiddleware** (`Shared/Store.Shared/Middleware/GlobalExceptionMiddleware.cs`)
- Logs all unhandled exceptions to the audit service
- Captures exception details, stack traces, and request context
- Provides fallback structured logging if audit service is unavailable

### 3. **Shared AuditLogClient** (`Shared/Store.Shared/Services/IAuditLogClient.cs`)
- Centralized audit log client that can be used by any service
- Uses the internal anonymous endpoint for reliable logging
- Provides local fallback logging if the audit service is unavailable

### 4. **Internal Audit Endpoint** (Enhanced `AuditLogController`)
- New anonymous `/api/auditlog/internal` endpoint for inter-service communication
- Allows audit logging even when authentication fails
- Maintains security by only accepting audit log data

## Authentication Events Now Logged

The `AuthService` now logs the following events with detailed context:

### Registration Events
- `USER_REGISTRATION_SUCCESS` - Successful user registration
- `USER_REGISTRATION_FAILED` - Failed registration (email exists, validation errors)
- `USER_REGISTRATION_ERROR` - System errors during registration

### Login Events
- `USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS` - Successful login
- `USER_LOGIN_FAILED` - Failed login (invalid credentials, account deactivated, user not found)
- `USER_LOGIN_ERROR` - System errors during login
- `DEMO_LOGIN_SUCCESS` - Successful demo user login
- `DEMO_LOGIN_FAILED` - Failed demo login
- `DEMO_ADMIN_LOGIN_SUCCESS` - Successful demo admin login
- `DEMO_ADMIN_LOGIN_FAILED` - Failed demo admin login

### Token Events
- `JWT_TOKEN_GENERATED` - When JWT tokens are created
- `TOKEN_REFRESH_SUCCESS` - Successful token refresh
- `TOKEN_REFRESH_FAILED` - Failed token refresh (invalid token, user not found)
- `TOKEN_REFRESH_ERROR` - System errors during token refresh

## HTTP Events Now Logged

The middleware automatically logs:

### Request/Response Events
- `HTTP_REQUEST` - All incoming API requests
- `HTTP_RESPONSE` - Successful responses (2xx-3xx)
- `HTTP_CLIENT_ERROR` - Client errors (4xx)
- `HTTP_SERVER_ERROR` - Server errors (5xx)

### Exception Events
- `HTTP_UNHANDLED_EXCEPTION` - Unhandled exceptions in middleware
- `GLOBAL_EXCEPTION` - Global exception handler catches

## Information Captured

Each audit log entry includes:

### Core Information
- **Action**: Type of event (e.g., USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS, HTTP_SERVER_ERROR)
- **EntityName**: What was affected (ApplicationUser, JWT, HttpRequest, etc.)
- **EntityId**: Unique identifier (User ID, Trace ID, etc.)
- **UserId**: ID of the user performing the action (if authenticated)
- **UserEmail**: Email of the user (if available)
- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **IpAddress**: Client IP address (with proxy header support)
- **UserAgent**: Client browser/application information

### Detailed Context (in AdditionalInfo)
- **Authentication Events**: Login method, roles, token expiration, failure reasons
- **HTTP Events**: Request/response details, status codes, headers, timing
- **Exception Events**: Exception type, message, stack trace, request context

### Change Tracking
- **OldValues**: Previous state (for updates like last login time)
- **NewValues**: New state after the change
- **Changes**: Summary of what changed

## Configuration

### Services Using Enhanced Audit Logging

The following services have been updated to use the new audit logging:

1. **IdentityService** - Logs all authentication events
2. **AuditLogService** - Logs its own HTTP traffic and exceptions

### Required Configuration

Add to your `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Services": {
    "AuditLogService": {
      "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:5004"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Querying Audit Logs

```bash
# Get all audit logs
GET /api/auditlog

# Get logs for a specific user
GET /api/auditlog/user/{userId}

# Get logs for authentication events
GET /api/auditlog/entity/ApplicationUser

# Get logs for HTTP errors
GET /api/auditlog/entity/HttpResponse?page=1&pageSize=50
```

### Sample Log Entries

**Successful Login:**
```json
{
  "action": "USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS",
  "entityName": "ApplicationUser",
  "entityId": "user-123",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "additionalInfo": {
    "loginMethod": "EmailPassword",
    "tokenExpiresAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "userRoles": ["user"]
  }
}
```

**HTTP 500 Error:**
```json
{
  "action": "HTTP_SERVER_ERROR",
  "entityName": "HttpResponse",
  "entityId": "trace-456",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "additionalInfo": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/api/auth/login",
    "statusCode": 500,
    "durationMs": 1234.5,
    "exceptionType": "SqlException",
    "exceptionMessage": "Database connection failed"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Sensitive Data**: Passwords, tokens, and sensitive headers are never logged
2. **Anonymous Endpoint**: The internal endpoint only accepts audit log data, not queries
3. **Fallback Logging**: If audit service fails, events are logged locally for investigation
4. **IP Detection**: Properly handles proxy headers for accurate IP tracking

## Performance Considerations

1. **Async Operations**: All audit logging is asynchronous and doesn't block main operations
2. **Error Isolation**: Audit logging failures never break the main application flow
3. **Selective Logging**: Skips noisy endpoints like health checks and static files
4. **Efficient Serialization**: Uses efficient JSON serialization for additional info

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check Audit Logs Are Working

1. **Perform a login** - Should create `USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS` entry
2. **Make an API call** - Should create `HTTP_REQUEST` and `HTTP_RESPONSE` entries
3. **Trigger an error** - Should create `HTTP_SERVER_ERROR` entry
4. **Check the logs** via GET `/api/auditlog` endpoint

### If Audit Logs Are Missing

1. **Check AuditLogService is running** on configured port
2. **Check database connection** for AuditLogService
3. **Check application logs** for audit logging errors
4. **Verify configuration** in appsettings.json

### Fallback Logging

If the audit service is unavailable, check your application logs for entries like:
```
AUDIT_LOG: {"action":"USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS","entityName":"ApplicationUser",...}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start your services** - IdentityService and AuditLogService
2. **Test authentication** - Login, register, demo login
3. **Check audit logs** - Query the audit log API to see captured events
4. **Monitor for errors** - Watch for 500 errors being captured
5. **Customize as needed** - Add more specific logging for your business requirements

The enhanced audit logging system now provides comprehensive visibility into all authentication events, HTTP errors, and system exceptions, giving you the detailed audit trail you requested.
